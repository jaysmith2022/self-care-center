### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learning goal was to make a function site using the data model and making the html and css from scratch. 
### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
I was able to get the data model to work correctly without really any issues. Also, I really liked messing with the CSS and getting that figured out. The biggest challenge was not getting errors based of the HTML I found a bug at the last minute in my HTML that caused me not to fully get the login page to work and it was too late to be able to make the full login page.
